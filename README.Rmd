# scclusteval

The goal of scclusteval is to evaluate the single cell clustering stability by
boostrapping the cells.

for Theory behind the method, see Christian Henning, “Cluster-wise assessment of
cluster stability,” Research Report 271, Dept. of Statistical Science, University 
College London, December 2006)

The process is as follows (paraphased from Stephen Eichhorn in Xiaowei Zhuang lab) :

1. Performing the clustering at many different K values on the full data set. 

2. We then sample without replacement a subset of the data set (e.g. 80% of the 
cells in the full data set), and then repeat the clustering procedure on just 
this subset of data (so repeating all aspects of clustering, including calling 
variable genes, calculating PCs, building the neighbor graph, etc), and we do 
this n (default 20) times. 

3. So for each K value, we have 1 clustering outcome for the full data set, 
and 20 clustering outcomes for subsampled portions of the data set. From this we
identify the cluster in the first subsample clustering that is most similar to 
the full cluster 1 cells (the one that gives the maximum Jaccard coefficient) and 
record that value. If this maximum Jaccard coefficient is less than 0.5, the 
original cluster is considered to be dissolved-it didn’t show up in the new clustering. 
A cluster that’s dissolved too often is probably not a “real” cluster.


4. Repeat this for all subsample clustering outcomes, and then the 
stability value of a cluster is the median or mean Jaccard coefficient. If it's 
greater than 0.5 we say it's stable, otherwise it's unstable. So for a given K 
value this gives you a stable/unstable assignment for each cluster. We choose the 
k value to select for clustering the data by looking at which k value yielded the 
largest number of stable clusters while still having most of the cells from the 
data set in a stable cluster. This second condition is important because as you 
decrease K, you will always get more clusters, and many of them will be stable, 
but there will also be a huge number of unstable clusters, so a small fraction 
of the data set will actually be described in stable clusters are these values. 

5. So what we typically see is that as K decreases, we get more stable clusters and no 
unstable clusters, then you reach a point where you decrease K and you get more stable 
clusters but also some unstable ones, so ~95% of the data is present in stable clusters, 
as you go down in K further you get more stable clusters but now something like 70% of 
the data is present in stable clusters. I choose the k value where at least 90% of the 
data was in a stable cluster, and the one that yielded the most stable clusters. 

6. This is almost always the smallest K value wherein at least 90% of the data was stable, 
but occasionally you see idiosyncratic behaviors from a particular k value, so it 
wouldn't be unheard of to see something where k=10 and k=8 were both >90% with respect 
to data in stable clusters, but k=10 had more stable clusters. In general we end up 
selecting k values around 8-12 in most cases.


As a rule of thumb, clusters with a stability value less than 0.6 should be considered 
unstable. Values between 0.6 and 0.75 indicate that the cluster is measuring a pattern 
in the data, but there isn’t high certainty about which points should be clustered 
together. Clusters with stability values above about 0.85 can be considered highly 
stable (they’re likely to be real clusters).
## Installation

You can install the released version of scclusteval from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("scclusteval")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
